Basic Template Python Project for Google AppEngine
=========================================

This is a basic template Python project which has the most basic setup needed for a Google AppEngine
application. Out of the box, the app will basically display "Hello World" at the root of the site using
the `jinja2` templeting engine.

**Important:**

 * Remember to change the `application` parameter in `app.yaml` file to the appropriate id
of your Google AppEngine project.
 * The project assumes you are using git for scm. It contains a `.gitignore` file

I created this project to make it easier for me to get started with any new Google AppEngine projects
in the future.
